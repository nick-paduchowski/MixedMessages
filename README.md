# MixedMessages - Lord of the Rings Character Generator

## Overview

For my first portfolio project, I decided to create a Lord of the Rings Character Generator that will pick a character, and then based on the characters stats, assign a small quest.

## Technologies

The technologies used in this project include:

* JavaScript
    The program itself is written in  the JavaScript programming language.
* Node.js
    The program can be run in the commandline using Node.js. Simply clone the repository and run the file with 'node lotrCharacterGenerator.js'
